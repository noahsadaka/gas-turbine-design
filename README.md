# Gas Turbine Design

This repository contains the code to solve for the turbine part of the project (Part C)

The Part_C.m script calculates:
 - Velocity Triangles at hub, mean, and tip
 - Rotation speed of the turbine and geometry of the vane and blade
 - Loss coefficients for nozzle and blade
 - Total-to-total efficiency of the entire stage

Still to do:
 - Determine the properties for an off-design 10% rotational speed reduction
 - Lifing of the blade
 - CATIA model of the stage
